## Prediksi Curah Hujan Wilayah Kota Palembang Melalui Penerapan Machine Learning Dengan Metoda Decision Tree
This research was
conducted with the aim of classifying based on the rain category with the dichotomy
of heavy rain and very heavy rain using data mining techniques with the CRISP-DM
methodology. The algorithm used in the classification technique is CART
(Classification And Regression Tree) with Confusion Matrix test parameters. Based
on the results of the model evaluation, it shows that the CART algorithm has a fairly
good performance in classifying with an accuracy value of 89.4%.
